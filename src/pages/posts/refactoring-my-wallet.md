# Refactoring My Wallet: Why I Treated My Finances Like a Legacy Codebase

As a developer, a big part of the job is debugging: find what breaks the code, fix it, and move on. Recently, I applied this same approach to my personal finances, and unsurprisingly, it worked wonders.

I realized my personal system was running on a buggy logic — mostly based on hope and rough estimation. I would see a big number in my account at the beginning of the month and assume, based on experience, that it "should work out."

But this approach had a critical bug: the "Paycheck Illusion." I felt rich on the 1st and broke on the 31st. Every unexpected expense crashed the system, making it impossible to grow any real financial leverage.

My financial stack needed a refactor. It needed to replace **hope** with **certainty** and introduce **minimal friction**.

## The Philosophy: The Waterfall Method

Most budgeting apps fail because they require too much manual input (runtime decisions). I wanted a system based on compiled logic.

I separated the solution into two components: the **Philosophy** and the **Implementation**.

The general idea is a "Waterfall System." Money flows into tanks that overflow into each other based on strict logic. The flow covers basic needs first, then savings, then lifestyle. If the flow stops (income drops), the non-essential tanks dry up first, protecting the core.

The flow looks like this:

> Income → Fixed Costs → Vault → Weekly Drip → Buffer → Leverage

## The Mechanics: The Hierarchy of Solidity

To make this work, I categorized every expense into a "Hierarchy of Solidity." The higher up the hierarchy, the harder the cost is to cut.

1. **Housing:** Impossible to cut quickly.
2. **Debt:** Legal consequences if unpaid.
3. **Bills/Insurance:** Service interruptions if unpaid.
4. **Groceries/Transport:** Can be compressed/optimized.
5. **Subscriptions:** Can be cut instantly.

When I need to optimize the system, I don't panic; I just execute a "garbage collection" routine starting from the bottom of the hierarchy.

## The Output: The Weekly Drip

The most important variable in this system is the **Weekly Drip**.

I don't look at my total bank balance anymore—that number is a lie. I only look at my Weekly Drip account. This is a dedicated account where a calculated allowance arrives automatically every Monday morning.

- **Drip Min:** The bare minimum needed to survive.
- **Drip Nice:** Survival plus "social tax" (coffees, dinners).
- **Drip Real:** What is mathematically possible based on current income.

## The Result: Automated Sanity

Once the system is set up, every weekend becomes a reward for an intentional week.

I can spend the money left in my Weekly Drip guilt-free. Or, I can let it overflow into the Buffer, knowing it increases the autonomy of my future self.

The cycle replaces the anxiety of "Can I afford this?" with the binary clarity of "Is there money in the Drip account?"

## Get the System

I built a Notion Dashboard to handle the calculations and visualize the tanks.
