# Hello World

This is my first note using the new Astro Content Collection system. The Content Layer API provides:

- **Type Safety**: All frontmatter is validated against the schema
- **Performance**: Static generation with optimized builds
- **Developer Experience**: Intellisense and error checking

## How it works

1. Create a markdown file in `src/content/notes/`
2. Add frontmatter that matches the schema
3. Astro automatically generates the page

This system transforms the way I write and publish notes, making the entire process more reliable and enjoyable.
